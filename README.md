A guess the number game is a popular and simple game where the player has to guess a random number chosen by the computer within a given range. I
In an Android app, this game can be developed using Java programming language.

The game can be designed as follows:

- The user interface of the game would have an input field where the user can enter their guessed number, and a button to submit their guess.
- When the game starts, the computer generates a random number within a specified range, and the player has to guess the number.
- After the player enters their guess, the app compares the guessed number with the generated number and displays a message indicating whether the guess is too high or too low or correct.
- The player continues to guess until they correctly guess the number.
- Once the player guesses the number correctly, the app displays a congratulatory message and offers to play again.
- The development of the game would require a good understanding of Java programming language, as well as the Android platform and user interface design.
- The app would need to handle various types of input and output, such as taking user input through the input field and 
button and displaying output through text views or dialog boxes.
